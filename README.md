This code appears to be a basic implementation of a text classification project using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a logistic regression model. The project takes a dataset of news articles, preprocesses the text by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, stemming words, and removing stopwords. The cleaned text is then converted into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization. The data is split into training and testing sets, and a logistic regression model is trained on the training data. The accuracy of the model is evaluated on both the training and testing data. Finally, the model is tested on a new data point, and the predicted label is printed along with the actual label.
